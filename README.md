### VBA of Wall Street
## Overview of Project

Steve has wanted us to prepare a workbook to analyze stocks for his parents. The purpose of this analysis is to give a better idea of the year to year performance of a dozen stocks. 

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
From the 2017 analysis, the stock "TERP" underperformed and would not be recommended to be invested in. In 2017, 11 out of the 12 stocks returned a positive return, while in 2018, 10 out of 12 stocks underperformed. From analyzing both years, the two stocks I would recommend to invest in would ENPH and RUN, they both had positive returns in both years. From the refactoring of the code, it was surpising to see even though the code was a little more sophisticated for the refactored, it was faster by a 1 second. 

## Summary
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages to refactoring code is that the code is adaptable to different situations and the code would be faster. The disadvantage is that it is not as simple and straight forward, so it does take more effort to code. 

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
With applying refactoring to the original VBA script, the code was more adaptable to analyzing the different stocks. The code was more challenging when refactoring, but it was worth the reward of a faster run time.
